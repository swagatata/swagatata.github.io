*In winter's icy grip, I stand alone,*
*A heart of stone, so cold and still,*
*The snowflakes fall, a soft bittersweet moan,*
*A love once found, now lost and killed.*

*The biting wind whispers tales of love,*
*Of warm embraces and tender kisses,*
*But I am left to mourn and shove,*
*Against the cruelness that love dismisses.*

*The fireside flickers, but brings no solace,*
*No warmth to thaw the chill in my soul,*
*For I am lost in this frigid place,*
*With only memories to console.*

*The long nights stretch, dark and cold,*
*A silent ache that never fades,*
*For in my heart, a love once bold,*
*Now withered, gone, and betrayed.*

*So here I stand, in winter's embrace,*
*Missing love that once was true,*
*A broken heart, a frozen face,*
*Longing for what I once knew.*
