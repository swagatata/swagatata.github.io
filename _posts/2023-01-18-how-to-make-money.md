## sell your time for money

We sell our time, sometimes years together to companies for wage. Though, it could be anywhere from 40 hours to 70 hours a week, we are still selling our time. 

It we are selling our time just for cash, it might be hard to build wealth as we grow. In our thirties and fourties, family becomes the priority. So, we won't have enough time to sell. 
So it's wise to gather equity in a viable business before one turns 30-35.

There are many stories of early employees becoming 10 or 100 millionaires, but are there still such companies out there, in 2023? We can look at the companies that are being funded recently
